      # Etherpad core dependencies must be installed after installing the
      # plugin's dependencies, otherwise npm will try to hoist common
      # dependencies by removing them from src/node_modules and installing them
      # in the top-level node_modules. As of v6.14.10, npm's hoist logic appears
      # to be buggy, because it sometimes removes dependencies from
      # src/node_modules but fails to add them to the top-level node_modules.
      # Even if npm correctly hoists the dependencies, the hoisting seems to
      # confuse tools such as `npm outdated`, `npm update`, and some ESLint
      # rules.
