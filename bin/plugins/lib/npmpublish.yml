      # doesn't support cloning outside of $GITHUB_WORKSPACE (see
      # https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/197), so the repo is first
      # cloned to etherpad-lite then moved to ../etherpad-lite. To avoid
      # conflicts with this plugin's clone, etherpad-lite must be cloned and
      # moved out before this plugin's repo is cloned to $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.

      # All of ep_etherpad-lite's devDependencies are installed because the
      # plugin might do `require('ep_etherpad-lite/node_modules/${devDep}')`.
      # Eventually it would be nice to create an ESLint plugin that prohibits
      # Etherpad plugins from piggybacking off of ep_etherpad-lite's
      # devDependencies. If we had that, we could change this line to only
      # install production dependencies.

      # This runs some sanity checks and creates a symlink at
      # node_modules/ep_etherpad-lite that points to ../../etherpad-lite/src.
      # This step must be done after `npm ci` installs the plugin's dependencies
      # because npm "helpfully" cleans up such symlinks. :( Installing
      # ep_etherpad-lite in the plugin's node_modules prevents lint errors and
      # unit test failures if the plugin does `require('ep_etherpad-lite/foo')`.

      # workflow runs to fail because they will all attempt to use the same
      # already-used version number. By running `npm publish` after `git push`,
      # back-to-back merges will cause the first merge's workflow to fail but
