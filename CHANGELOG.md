# 2.2.7


### Notable enhancements and fixes

- We migrated all important pages to React 19 and React Router v7

Besides that only dependency updates.


 -> Have a merry Christmas and a happy new year.  🎄 🎁


# 2.2.6

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Added option to delete a pad by the creator. This option can be found in the settings menu. When you click on it you get a confirm dialog and after that you have the chance to completely erase the pad.


# 2.2.5

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Fixed timeslider not scrolling when the revision count is a multiple of 100
- Added new Restful API for version 2 of Etherpad. It is available at /api-docs


# 2.2.4

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Switched to new SQLite backend
- Fixed rusty-store-kv module not found


# 2.2.3

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Introduced a new in process database `rustydb` that represents a fast key value store written in Rust.
- Readded window._ as a shortcut for getting text
- Added support for migrating any ueberdb database to another. You can now switch as you please. See here: https://docs.etherpad.org/cli.html
- Further Typescript movements
- A lot of security issues fixed and reviewed in this release. Please update.


# 2.2.2

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Removal of Etherpad require kernel: We finally managed to include esbuild to bundle our frontend code together. So no matter how many plugins your server has it is always one JavaScript file. This boosts performance dramatically.
- Added log layoutType: This lets you print the log in either colored or basic (black and white text)
- Introduced esbuild for bundling CSS files
- Cache all files to be bundled in memory for faster load speed


# 2.1.1


### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Fixed failing Docker build when checked out as git submodule. Thanks to @neurolabs
- Fixed: Fallback to websocket and polling when unknown(old) config is present for socket io
- Fixed: Next page disabled if zero page by @samyakj023
- On CTRL+CLICK bring the window back to focus by Helder Sepulveda

# 2.1.0

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Added PWA support. You can now add your Etherpad instance to your home screen on your mobile device or desktop.
- Fixed live plugin manager versions clashing. Thanks to @yacchin1205
- Fixed a bug in the pad panel where pagination was not working correctly when sorting by pad name

### Compatibility changes

- Reintroduced APIKey.txt support. You can now switch between APIKey and OAuth2.0 authentication. This can be toggled with the setting authenticationMethod. The default is OAuth2. If you want to use the APIKey method you can set that to `apikey`.


# 2.0.3

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Added documentation for replacing apikeys with oauth2
- Bumped live plugin manager to 0.20.0. Thanks to @fgreinacher
- Added better documentation for using docker-compose with Etherpad



# 2.0.2

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Fixed the locale loading in the admin panel
- Added OAuth2.0 support for the Etherpad API. You can now log in  into the Etherpad API with your admin user using OAuth2

### Compatibility changes

- The tests now require generating a token from the OAuth secret. You can find the `generateJWTToken` in the common.ts script for plugin endpoint updates.


# 2.0.1

### Notable enhancements and fixes

- Fixed a bug where a plugin depending on a scoped dependency would not install successfully.


# 2.0.0


### Compatibility changes

- Socket io has been updated to 4.7.5. This means that the json.send function won't work anymore and needs to be changed to .emit('message', myObj)
- Deprecating npm version 6 in favor of pnpm: We have made the decision to switch to the well established pnpm (https://pnpm.io/). It works by symlinking dependencies into a global directory allowing you to have a cleaner and more reliable environment.
- Introducing Typescript to the Etherpad core: Etherpad core logic has been rewritten in Typescript allowing for compiler checking of errors.
- Rewritten Admin Panel: The Admin panel has been rewritten in React and now features a more pleasant user experience. It now also features an integrated pad searching with sorting functionality.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Bugfixes
  - Live Plugin Manager: The live plugin manager caused problems when a plugin had depdendencies defined. This issue is now resolved.

* Enhancements
  - pnpm Workspaces: In addition to pnpm we introduced workspaces. A clean way to manage multiple bounded contexts like the admin panel or the bin folder.
  - Bin folder: The bin folder has been moved from the src folder to the root folder. This change was necessary as the contained scripts do not represent core functionality of the user.
  - Starting Etherpad: Etherpad can now be started with a single command: `pnpm run prod` in the root directory.
  - Installing Etherpad: Etherpad no longer symlinks itself in the root directory. This is now also taken care by pnpm, and it just creates a node_modules folder with the src directory`s ep_etherpad-lite folder
  - Plugins can now be installed simply via the command: `pnpm run plugins i first-plugin second-plugin` or if you want to install from path you can do:
  `pnpm run plugins i --path ../path-to-plugin`


# 1.9.7

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Added Live Plugin Manager: Plugins are now installed into a separate folder on the host system. This folder is called `plugin_packages`.
That way the plugins are separated from the normal etherpad installation.
* Make repairPad.js more verbose
* Fixed favicon not being loaded correctly

# 1.9.6

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Prevent etherpad crash when update server is not reachable
* Use npm@6 in Docker build
* Fix setting the log level in settings.json


# 1.9.5

### Compatibility changes

* This version deprecates NodeJS16 as it reached its end of life and won't receive any updates. So to get started with Etherpad v1.9.5 you need NodeJS 18 and above.
* The bundled windows NodeJS version has been bumped to the current LTS version 20.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* The support for the tidy program to tidy up HTML files has been removed. This decision was made because it hasn't been updated for years and also caused an incompability when exporting a pad with Abiword.


# 1.9.4

### Compatibility changes

* Log4js has been updated to the latest version. As it involved a bump of 6 major version.
  A lot has changed since then. Most notably the console appender has been deprecated. You can find out more about it [here](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-node)

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Fix for MySQL: The logger calls were incorrectly configured leading to a crash when e.g. somebody uses a different encoding than standard MySQL encoding.

# 1.9.3

### Compability changes

* express-rate-limit has been bumped to 7.0.0: This involves the breaking change that "max: 0"
in the importExportRateLimiting is set to always trigger. So set it to your desired value.
If you haven't changed that value in the settings.json you are all set.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Bugfixes
  * Fix etherpad crashing with mongodb database

* Enhancements
  * Add surrealdb database support. You can find out more about this database [here](https://surrealdb.com).
  * Make sqlite faster: The sqlite library has been switched to better-sqlite3. This should lead to better performance.

# 1.9.2

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Security
  * Enable session key rotation: This setting can be enabled in the settings.json. It changes the signing key for the cookie authentication in a fixed interval.

* Bugfixes
  * Fix appendRevision when creating a new pad via the API without a text.


* Enhancements
  * Bump JQuery to version 3.7
  * Update elasticsearch connector to version 8

### Compatibility changes

* No compability changes as JQuery maintains excellent backwards compatibility.

#### For plugin authors

* Please update to JQuery 3.7. There is an excellent deprecation guide over [here](https://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/). Version 3.1 to 3.7 are relevant for the upgrade.

# 1.9.1

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Security
  * Limit requested revisions in timeslider and export to head revision. (affects v1.9.0)

* Bugfixes
  * revisions in `CHANGESET_REQ` (timeslider) and export (txt, html, custom)
    are now checked to be numbers.
  * bump sql for audit fix
* Enhancements
  * Add keybinding meta-backspace to delete to beginning of line
  * Fix automatic Windows build via GitHub Actions
  * Enable docs to be build cross platform thanks to asciidoctor

### Compatibility changes
* tests: drop windows 7 test coverage & use chrome latest for admin tests
* Require Node 16 for Etherpad and target Node 20 for testing


# 1.9.0

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Windows build:
  * The bundled `node.exe` was upgraded from v12 to v16.
  * The bundled `node.exe` is now a 64-bit executable. If you need the 32-bit
    version you must download and install Node.js yourself.
* Improvements to login session management:
  * `express_sid` cookies and `sessionstorage:*` database records are no longer
    created unless `requireAuthentication` is `true` (or a plugin causes them to
    be created).
  * Login sessions now have a finite lifetime by default (10 days after
    leaving).
  * `sessionstorage:*` database records are automatically deleted when the login
    session expires (with some exceptions that will be fixed in the future).
  * Requests for static content (e.g., `/robots.txt`) and special pages (e.g.,
    the HTTP API, `/stats`) no longer create login session state.
  * The secret used to sign the `express_sid` cookie is now automatically
    regenerated every day (called *key rotation*) by default. If key rotation is
    enabled, the now-deprecated `SESSIONKEY.txt` file can be safely deleted
    after Etherpad starts up (its content is read and saved to the database and
    used to validate signatures from old cookies until they expire).
* The following settings from `settings.json` are now applied as expected (they
  were unintentionally ignored before):
  * `padOptions.lang`
  * `padOptions.showChat`
  * `padOptions.userColor`
  * `padOptions.userName`
* HTTP API:
  * Fixed the return value of `getText` when called with a specific revision.
  * Fixed a potential attribute pool corruption bug with
    `copyPadWithoutHistory`.
  * Mappings created by `createGroupIfNotExistsFor` are now removed from the
    database when the group is deleted.
  * Fixed race conditions in the `setText`, `appendText`, and `restoreRevision`
    functions.
  * Added an optional `authorId` parameter to `appendText`,
    `copyPadWithoutHistory`, `createGroupPad`, `createPad`, `restoreRevision`,
    `setHTML`, and `setText`, and bumped the latest API version to 1.3.0.
* Fixed a crash if the database is busy enough to cause a query timeout.
* New `/health` endpoint for getting information about Etherpad's health (see
  [draft-inadarei-api-health-check-06](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-06.html)).
* Docker now uses the new `/health` endpoint for health checks, which avoids
  issues when authentication is enabled. It also avoids the unnecessary creation
  of database records for managing browser sessions.
* When copying a pad, the pad's records are copied in batches to avoid database
  timeouts with large pads.
* Exporting a large pad to `.etherpad` format should be faster thanks to bulk
  database record fetches.
* When importing an `.etherpad` file, records are now saved to the database in
  batches to avoid database timeouts with large pads.

#### For plugin authors

* New `expressPreSession` server-side hook.
* Pad server-side hook changes:
  * `padCheck`: New hook.
  * `padCopy`: New `srcPad` and `dstPad` context properties.
  * `padDefaultContent`: New hook.
  * `padRemove`: New `pad` context property.
* The `db` property on Pad objects is now public.
* New `getAuthorId` server-side hook.
* New APIs for processing attributes: `ep_etherpad-lite/static/js/attributes`
  (low-level API) and `ep_etherpad-lite/static/js/AttributeMap` (high-level
  API).
* The `import` server-side hook has a new `ImportError` context property.
* New `exportEtherpad` and `importEtherpad` server-side hooks.
* The `handleMessageSecurity` and `handleMessage` server-side hooks have a new
  `sessionInfo` context property that includes the user's author ID, the pad ID,
  and whether the user only has read-only access.
* The `handleMessageSecurity` server-side hook can now be used to grant write
  access for the current message only.
* The `init_<pluginName>` server-side hooks have a new `logger` context
  property that plugins can use to log messages.
* Prevent infinite loop when exiting the server
* Bump dependencies


### Compatibility changes

* Node.js v14.15.0 or later is now required.
* The default login session expiration (applicable if `requireAuthentication` is
  `true`) changed from never to 10 days after the user leaves.

#### For plugin authors

* The `client` context property for the `handleMessageSecurity` and
  `handleMessage` server-side hooks is deprecated; use the `socket` context
  property instead.
* Pad server-side hook changes:
  * `padCopy`:
    * The `originalPad` context property is deprecated; use `srcPad` instead.
    * The `destinationID` context property is deprecated; use `dstPad.id`
      instead.
  * `padCreate`: The `author` context property is deprecated; use the new
    `authorId` context property instead. Also, the hook now runs asynchronously.
  * `padLoad`: Now runs when a temporary Pad object is created during import.
    Also, it now runs asynchronously.
  * `padRemove`: The `padID` context property is deprecated; use `pad.id`
    instead.
  * `padUpdate`: The `author` context property is deprecated; use the new
    `authorId` context property instead. Also, the hook now runs asynchronously.
* Returning `true` from a `handleMessageSecurity` hook function is deprecated;
  return `'permitOnce'` instead.
* Changes to the `src/static/js/Changeset.js` library:
  * The following attribute processing functions are deprecated (use the new
    attribute APIs instead):
    * `attribsAttributeValue()`
    * `eachAttribNumber()`
    * `makeAttribsString()`
    * `opAttributeValue()`
  * `opIterator()`: Deprecated in favor of the new `deserializeOps()` generator
    function.
  * `appendATextToAssembler()`: Deprecated in favor of the new `opsFromAText()`
    generator function.
  * `newOp()`: Deprecated in favor of the new `Op` class.
* The `AuthorManager.getAuthor4Token()` function is deprecated; use the new
  `AuthorManager.getAuthorId()` function instead.
* The exported database records covered by the `exportEtherpadAdditionalContent`
  server-side hook now include keys like `${customPrefix}:${padId}:*`, not just
  `${customPrefix}:${padId}`.
* Plugin locales should overwrite core's locales Stale
* Plugin locales overwrite core locales

# 1.8.18

Released: 2022-05-05

### Notable enhancements and fixes

  * Upgraded ueberDB to fix a regression with CouchDB.

# 1.8.17

Released: 2022-02-23

### Security fixes

* Fixed a vunlerability in the `CHANGESET_REQ` message handler that allowed a
  user with any access to read any pad if the pad ID is known.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused all pad edit messages received at the server to go
  through a single queue. Now there is a separate queue per pad as intended,
  which should reduce message processing latency when many pads are active at
  the same time.

# 1.8.16

### Security fixes

If you cannot upgrade to v1.8.16 for some reason, you are encouraged to try
cherry-picking the fixes to the version you are running:

```shell
git cherry-pick b7065eb9a0ec..77bcb507b30e
```

* Maliciously crafted `.etherpad` files can no longer overwrite arbitrary
  non-pad database records when imported.
* Imported `.etherpad` files are now subject to numerous consistency checks
  before any records are written to the database. This should help avoid
  denial-of-service attacks via imports of malformed `.etherpad` files.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Fixed several `.etherpad` import bugs.
* Improved support for large `.etherpad` imports.

# 1.8.15

### Security fixes

* Fixed leak of the writable pad ID when exporting from the pad's read-only ID.
  This only matters if you treat the writeable pad IDs as secret (e.g., you are
  not using [ep_padlist2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_padlist2)) and you
  share the pad's read-only ID with untrusted users. Instead of treating
  writeable pad IDs as secret, you are encouraged to take advantage of
  Etherpad's authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., use
  [ep_openid_connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_openid_connect) with
  [ep_readonly_guest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_readonly_guest), or write
  your own
  [authentication](https://etherpad.org/doc/v1.8.14/#index_authenticate) and
  [authorization](https://etherpad.org/doc/v1.8.14/#index_authorize) plugins).
* Updated dependencies.

### Compatibility changes

* The `logconfig` setting is deprecated.

#### For plugin authors

* Etherpad now uses [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) instead of
  [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) for processing HTML imports. There are two
  consequences of this change:
  * `require('ep_etherpad-lite/node_modules/cheerio')` no longer works. To fix,
    your plugin should directly depend on `cheerio` and do `require('cheerio')`.
  * The `collectContentImage` hook's `node` context property is now an
    [`HTMLImageElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement)
    object rather than a Cheerio Node-like object, so the API is slightly
    different. See
    [citizenos/ep_image_upload#49](https://github.com/citizenos/ep_image_upload/pull/49)
    for an example fix.
* The `clientReady` server-side hook is deprecated; use the new `userJoin` hook
  instead.
* The `init_<pluginName>` server-side hooks are now run every time Etherpad
  starts up, not just the first time after the named plugin is installed.
* The `userLeave` server-side hook's context properties have changed:
  * `auth`: Deprecated.
  * `author`: Deprecated; use the new `authorId` property instead.
  * `readonly`: Deprecated; use the new `readOnly` property instead.
  * `rev`: Deprecated.
* Changes to the `src/static/js/Changeset.js` library:
  * `opIterator()`: The unused start index parameter has been removed, as has
    the unused `lastIndex()` method on the returned object.
  * `smartOpAssembler()`: The returned object's `appendOpWithText()` method is
    deprecated without a replacement available to plugins (if you need one, let
    us know and we can make the private `opsFromText()` function public).
  * Several functions that should have never been public are no longer exported:
    `applyZip()`, `assert()`, `clearOp()`, `cloneOp()`, `copyOp()`, `error()`,
    `followAttributes()`, `opString()`, `stringOp()`, `textLinesMutator()`,
    `toBaseTen()`, `toSplices()`.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* Accessibility fix for JAWS screen readers.
* Fixed "clear authorship" error (see issue #5128).
* Etherpad now considers square brackets to be valid URL characters.
* The server no longer crashes if an exception is thrown while processing a
  message from a client.
* The `useMonospaceFontGlobal` setting now works (thanks @Lastpixl!).
* Chat improvements:
  * The message input field is now a text area, allowing multi-line messages
    (use shift-enter to insert a newline).
  * Whitespace in chat messages is now preserved.
* Docker improvements:
  * New `HEALTHCHECK` instruction (thanks @Gared!).
  * New `settings.json` variables: `DB_COLLECTION`, `DB_URL`,
    `SOCKETIO_MAX_HTTP_BUFFER_SIZE`, `DUMP_ON_UNCLEAN_EXIT` (thanks
    @JustAnotherArchivist!).
  * `.ep_initialized` files are no longer created.
* Worked around a [Firefox Content Security Policy
  bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1721296) that caused CSP
  failures when `'self'` was in the CSP header. See issue #4975 for details.
* UeberDB upgraded from v1.4.10 to v1.4.18. For details, see the [ueberDB
  changelog](https://github.com/ether/ueberDB/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
  Highlights:
  * The `postgrespool` driver was renamed to `postgres`, replacing the old
    driver of that name. If you used the old `postgres` driver, you may see an
    increase in the number of database connections.
  * For `postgres`, you can now set the `dbSettings` value in `settings.json` to
    a connection string (e.g., `"postgres://user:password@host/dbname"`) instead
    of an object.
  * For `mongodb`, the `dbName` setting was renamed to `database` (but `dbName`
    still works for backwards compatibility) and is now optional (if unset, the
    database name in `url` is used).
* `/admin/settings` now honors the `--settings` command-line argument.
* Fixed "Author *X* tried to submit changes as author *Y*" detection.
* Error message display improvements.
* Simplified pad reload after importing an `.etherpad` file.

#### For plugin authors

* `clientVars` was added to the context for the `postAceInit` client-side hook.
  Plugins should use this instead of the `clientVars` global variable.
* New `userJoin` server-side hook.
* The `userLeave` server-side hook has a new `socket` context property.
* The `helper.aNewPad()` function (accessible to client-side tests) now
  accepts hook functions to inject when opening a pad. This can be used to
  test any new client-side hooks your plugin provides.
* Chat improvements:
  * The `chatNewMessage` client-side hook context has new properties:
    * `message`: Provides access to the raw message object so that plugins can
      see the original unprocessed message text and any added metadata.
    * `rendered`: Allows plugins to completely override how the message is
      rendered in the UI.
  * New `chatSendMessage` client-side hook that enables plugins to process the
    text before sending it to the server or augment the message object with
    custom metadata.
  * New `chatNewMessage` server-side hook to process new chat messages before
    they are saved to the database and relayed to users.
* Readability improvements to browser-side error stack traces.
* Added support for socket.io message acknowledgments.

# 1.8.14

### Security fixes

* Fixed a persistent XSS vulnerability in the Chat component. In case you can't
  update to 1.8.14 directly, we strongly recommend to cherry-pick
  a7968115581e20ef47a533e030f59f830486bdfa. Thanks to sonarsource for the
  professional disclosure.

### Compatibility changes

* Node.js v12.13.0 or later is now required.
* The `favicon` setting is now interpreted as a pathname to a favicon file, not
  a URL. Please see the documentation comment in `settings.json.template`.
* The undocumented `faviconPad` and `faviconTimeslider` settings have been
  removed.
* MySQL/MariaDB now uses connection pooling, which means you will see up to 10
  connections to the MySQL/MariaDB server (by default) instead of 1. This might
  cause Etherpad to crash with a "ER_CON_COUNT_ERROR: Too many connections"
  error if your server is configured with a low connection limit.
* Changes to environment variable substitution in `settings.json` (see the
  documentation comments in `settings.json.template` for details):
  * An environment variable set to the string "null" now becomes `null` instead
    of the string "null". Similarly, if the environment variable is unset and
    the default value is "null" (e.g., `"${UNSET_VAR:null}"`), the value now
    becomes `null` instead of the string "null". It is no longer possible to
    produce the string "null" via environment variable substitution.
  * An environment variable set to the string "undefined" now causes the setting
    to be removed instead of set to the string "undefined". Similarly, if the
    environment variable is unset and the default value is "undefined" (e.g.,
    `"${UNSET_VAR:undefined}"`), the setting is now removed instead of set to
    the string "undefined". It is no longer possible to produce the string
    "undefined" via environment variable substitution.
  * Support for unset variables without a default value is now deprecated.
    Please change all instances of `"${FOO}"` in your `settings.json` to
    `${FOO:null}` to keep the current behavior.
  * The `DB_*` variable substitutions in `settings.json.docker` that previously
    defaulted to `null` now default to "undefined".
* Calling `next` without argument when using `Changeset.opIterator` does always
  return a new Op. See b9753dcc7156d8471a5aa5b6c9b85af47f630aa8 for details.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* MySQL/MariaDB now uses connection pooling, which should improve stability and
  reduce latency.
* Bulk database writes are now retried individually on write failure.
* Minify: Avoid crash due to unhandled Promise rejection if stat fails.
* padIds are now included in /socket.io query string, e.g.
  `https://video.etherpad.com/socket.io/?padId=AWESOME&EIO=3&transport=websocket&t=...&sid=...`.
  This is useful for directing pads to separate socket.io nodes.
* <script> elements added via aceInitInnerdocbodyHead hook are now executed.
* Fix read only pad access with authentication.
* Await more db writes.
* Disabled wtfnode dump by default.
* Send `USER_NEWINFO` messages on reconnect.
* Fixed loading in a hidden iframe.
* Fixed a race condition with composition. (Thanks @ingoncalves for an
  exceptionally detailed analysis and @rhansen for the fix.)

# 1.8.13

### Notable fixes

* Fixed a bug in the safeRun.sh script (#4935)
* Add more endpoints that do not need authentication/authorization (#4921)
* Fixed issue with non-opening device keyboard on smartphones (#4929)
* Add version string to iframe_editor.css to prevent stale cache entry (#4964)

### Notable enhancements

* Refactor pad loading (no document.write anymore) (#4960)
* Improve import/export functionality, logging and tests (#4957)
* Refactor CSS manager creation (#4963)
* Better metrics
* Add test for client height (#4965)

* ueberDB2 1.3.2 -> 1.4.4
* express-rate-limit 5.2.5 -> 5.2.6
* etherpad-require-kernel 1.0.9 -> 1.0.11

# 1.8.12

Special mention: Thanks to Sauce Labs for additional testing tunnels to help us
grow! :)

### Security patches

* Fixed a regression in v1.8.11 which caused some pad names to cause Etherpad to
  restart.

### Notable fixes

* Fixed a bug in the `dirty` database driver that sometimes caused Node.js to
  crash during shutdown and lose buffered database writes.
* Fixed a regression in v1.8.8 that caused "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read
  property '0' of undefined" with some plugins (#4885)
* Less warnings in server console for supported element types on import.
* Support Azure and other network share installations by using a more truthful
  relative path.

### Notable enhancements

### Compatibility changes

* Node.js 10.17.0 or newer is now required.
* The `bin/` and `tests/` directories were moved under `src/`. Symlinks were
  added at the old locations to hopefully avoid breaking user scripts and other
  tools.
* Dependencies are now installed with the `--no-optional` flag to speed
  installation. Optional dependencies such as `sqlite3` must now be manually
  installed (e.g., `(cd src && npm i sqlite3)`).
* Socket.IO messages are now limited to 10K bytes to make denial of service
  attacks more difficult. This may cause issues when pasting large amounts of
  text or with plugins that send large messages (e.g., `ep_image_upload`). You
  can change the limit via `settings.json`; see `socketIo.maxHttpBufferSize`.
* The top-level `package.json` file, added in v1.8.7, has been removed due to
  problematic npm behavior. Whenever you install a plugin you will see the
  following benign warnings that can be safely ignored:

  ```
  npm WARN saveError ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../package.json'
  npm WARN enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../package.json'
  npm WARN develop No description
  npm WARN develop No repository field.
  npm WARN develop No README data
  npm WARN develop No license field.
  ```

### Notable enhancements

* You can now generate a link to a specific line number in a pad. Appending
  `#L10` to a pad URL will cause your browser to scroll down to line 10.
* Database performance is significantly improved.
* Admin UI now has test coverage in CI. (The tests are not enabled by default;
  see `settings.json`.)
* New stats/metrics: `activePads`, `httpStartTime`, `lastDisconnected`,
  `memoryUsageHeap`.
* Improved import UX.
* Browser caching improvements.
* Users can now pick absolute white (`#fff`) as their color.
* The `settings.json` template used for Docker images has new variables for
  controlling rate limiting.
* Admin UI now has test coverage in CI. (The tests are not enabled by default
  because the admin password is required; see `settings.json`.)
* For plugin authors:
  * New `callAllSerial()` function that invokes hook functions like `callAll()`
    except it supports asynchronous hook functions.
  * `callFirst()` and `aCallFirst()` now support the same wide range of hook
    function behaviors that `callAll()`, `aCallAll()`, and `callAllSerial()`
    support. Also, they now warn when a hook function misbehaves.
  * The following server-side hooks now support asynchronous hook functions:
    `expressConfigure`, `expressCreateServer`, `padCopy`, `padRemove`
  * Backend tests for plugins can now use the
    [`ep_etherpad-lite/tests/backend/common`](src/tests/backend/common.js)
    module to start the server and simplify API access.
  * The `checkPlugins.js` script now automatically adds GitHub CI test coverage
    badges for backend tests and npm publish.

### Notable fixes

* Enter key now stays in focus when inserted at bottom of viewport.
* Numbering for ordered list items now properly increments when exported to
  text.
* Suppressed benign socket.io connection errors
* Interface no longer loses color variants on disconnect/reconnect event.
* General code quality is further significantly improved.
* Restarting Etherpad via `/admin` actions is more robust.
* Improved reliability of server shutdown and restart.
* No longer error if no buttons are visible.
* For plugin authors:
  * Fixed `collectContentLineText` return value handling.

# 1.8.7
### Compatibility-breaking changes
* **IMPORTANT:** It is no longer possible to protect a group pad with a
  password. All API calls to `setPassword` or `isPasswordProtected` will fail.
  Existing group pads that were previously password protected will no longer be
  password protected. If you need fine-grained access control, you can restrict
  API session creation in your frontend service, or you can use plugins.
* All workarounds for Microsoft Internet Explorer have been removed. IE might
  still work, but it is untested.
* Plugin hook functions are now subject to new sanity checks. Buggy hook
  functions will cause an error message to be logged
* Authorization failures now return 403 by default instead of 401
* The `authorize` hook is now only called after successful authentication. Use
  the new `preAuthorize` hook if you need to bypass authentication
* The `authFailure` hook is deprecated; use the new `authnFailure` and
  `authzFailure` hooks instead
* The `indexCustomInlineScripts` hook was removed
* The `client` context property for the `handleMessage` and
  `handleMessageSecurity` hooks has been renamed to `socket` (the old name is
  still usable but deprecated)
* The `aceAttribClasses` hook functions are now called synchronously
* The format of `ENTER`, `CREATE`, and `LEAVE` log messages has changed
* Strings passed to `$.gritter.add()` are now expected to be plain text, not
  HTML. Use jQuery or DOM objects if you need formatting

### Notable new features
* Users can now import without creating and editing the pad first
* Added a new `readOnly` user setting that makes it possible to create users in
  `settings.json` that can read pads but not create or modify them
* Added a new `canCreate` user setting that makes it possible to create users in
  `settings.json` that can modify pads but not create them
* The `authorize` hook now accepts `readOnly` to grant read-only access to a pad
* The `authorize` hook now accepts `modify` to grant modify-only (creation
  prohibited) access to a pad
* All authentication successes and failures are now logged
* Added a new `cookie.sameSite` setting that makes it possible to enable
  authentication when Etherpad is embedded in an iframe from another site
* New `exportHTMLAdditionalContent` hook to include additional HTML content
* New `exportEtherpadAdditionalContent` hook to include additional database
  content in `.etherpad` exports
* New `expressCloseServer` hook to close Express when required
* The `padUpdate` hook context now includes `revs` and `changeset`
* `checkPlugin.js` has various improvements to help plugin developers
* The HTTP request object (and therefore the express-session state) is now
  accessible from within most `eejsBlock_*` hooks
* Users without a `password` or `hash` property in `settings.json` are no longer
  ignored, so they can now be used by authentication plugins
* New permission denied modal and block ``permissionDenied``
* Plugins are now updated to the latest version instead of minor or patches

### Notable fixes
* Fixed rate limit accounting when Etherpad is behind a reverse proxy
* Fixed typos that prevented access to pads via an HTTP API session
* Fixed authorization failures for pad URLs containing a percent-encoded
  character
* Fixed exporting of read-only pads
* Passwords are no longer written to connection state database entries or logged
  in debug logs
* When using the keyboard to navigate through the toolbar buttons the button
  with the focus is now highlighted
* Fixed support for Node.js 10 by passing the `--experimental-worker` flag
* Fixed export of HTML attributes within a line
* Fixed occasional "Cannot read property 'offsetTop' of undefined" error in
  timeslider when "follow pad contents" is checked
* socket.io errors are now displayed instead of silently ignored
* Pasting while the caret is in a link now works (except for middle-click paste
  on X11 systems)
* Removal of Microsoft Internet Explorer specific code
* Import better handles line breaks and white space
* Fix issue with ``createDiffHTML`` incorrect call of ``getInternalRevisionAText``
* Allow additional characters in URLs
* MySQL engine fix and various other UeberDB updates (See UeberDB changelog).
* Admin UI improvements on search results (to remove duplicate items)
* Removal of unused cruft from ``clientVars`` (``ip`` and ``userAgent``)


### Minor changes

* Toolbar layout for narrow screens is improved
* Fixed `SameSite` cookie attribute for the `language`, `token`, and `pref`
  cookies
* Fixed superfluous database accesses when deleting a pad
* Expanded test coverage.
