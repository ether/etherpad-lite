# 1.8.7
### Compatibility-breaking changes
* **IMPORTANT:** It is no longer possible to protect a group pad with a
  password. All API calls to `setPassword` or `isPasswordProtected` will fail.
  Existing group pads that were previously password protected will no longer be
  password protected. If you need fine-grained access control, you can restrict
  API session creation in your frontend service, or you can use plugins.
* Plugin hook functions are now subject to new sanity checks. Buggy hook
  functions will cause an error message to be logged
* Authorization failures now return 403 by default instead of 401
* The `authorize` hook is now only called after successful authentication. Use
  the new `preAuthorize` hook if you need to bypass authentication
* The `authFailure` hook is deprecated; use the new `authnFailure` and
  `authzFailure` hooks instead
* The `indexCustomInlineScripts` hook was removed
* The `client` context property for the `handleMessage` and
  `handleMessageSecurity` hooks has been renamed to `socket` (the old name is
  still usable but deprecated)
* The `aceAttribClasses` hook functions are now called synchronously
* The format of `ENTER`, `CREATE`, and `LEAVE` log messages has changed
* Strings passed to `$.gritter.add()` are now expected to be plain text, not
  HTML. Use jQuery or DOM objects if you need formatting

### Notable new features
* Users can now import without creating and editing the pad first
* Added a new `readOnly` user setting that makes it possible to create users in
  `settings.json` that can read pads but not create or modify them
* Added a new `canCreate` user setting that makes it possible to create users in
  `settings.json` that can modify pads but not create them
* The `authorize` hook now accepts `readOnly` to grant read-only access to a pad
* The `authorize` hook now accepts `modify` to grant modify-only (creation
  prohibited) access to a pad
* All authentication successes and failures are now logged
* Added a new `cookie.sameSite` setting that makes it possible to enable
  authentication when Etherpad is embedded in an iframe from another site
* New `exportHTMLAdditionalContent` hook to include additional HTML content
* New `exportEtherpadAdditionalContent` hook to include additional database
  content in `.etherpad` exports
* The `padUpdate` hook context now includes `revs` and `changeset`
* `checkPlugins.js` has various improvements to help plugin developers
* The HTTP request object (and therefore the express-session state) is now
  accessible from within most `eejsBlock_*` hooks
* Users without a `password` or `hash` property in `settings.json` are no longer
  ignored, so they can now be used by authentication plugins

### Notable fixes
* Fixed rate limit accounting when Etherpad is behind a reverse proxy
* Fixed typos that prevented access to pads via an HTTP API session
* Fixed authorization failures for pad URLs containing a percent-encoded
  character
* Fixed exporting of read-only pads
* Passwords are no longer written to connection state database entries or logged
  in debug logs
* When using the keyboard to navigate through the toolbar buttons the button
  with the focus is now highlighted
* Fixed support for Node.js 10 by passing the `--experimental-worker` flag
* Fixed export of HTML attributes within a line
* Fixed occasional "Cannot read property 'offsetTop' of undefined" error in
  timeslider when "follow pad contents" is checked
* socket.io errors are now displayed instead of silently ignored
* Pasting while the caret is in a link now works (except for middle-click paste
  on X11 systems)

### Minor changes
* Temporary disconnections no longer force a full page refresh
* Toolbar layout for narrow screens is improved
* Fixed `SameSite` cookie attribute for the `language`, `token`, and `pref`
  cookies
* Fixed superfluous database accesses when deleting a pad
* Expanded test coverage.
* `package-lock.json` is now lint checked on commit
