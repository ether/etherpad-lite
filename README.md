# About
Etherpad lite is a really-real time collaborative editor spawned from the Hell fire of Etherpad. 
We're reusing the well tested Etherpad easysync library to make it really realtime. Etherpad Lite 
is based on node.js what makes it much ligther and more stable than the original Etherpad. Our hope 
is that this will encourage more users to install a realtime collaborative editor. A smaller and well 
documented codebase makes it easier for developers to improve the code. Etherpad Lite is optimized 
to be easy embeddable

**Online demo**<br>
Visit <http://pitapoison.de:9001> to test it live. You can find the same instance behind a nginx, with ssl and in a subpath here -> [https://pad.pitapoison.de/pad/](https://pad.pitapoison.de/pad/)

# Installation
1. Download latest node.js version from <http://nodejs.org/> and build it with this instructions <https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation>. <br>
The Node.js version of your Linux repository might be too old/new. Please compile from the source to get sure you have the correct version. We support node.js version 0.4.*
2. Install npm `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`
3. Ensure you have installed the sqlite develob libraries, gzip and git `apt-get install libsqlite3-dev gzip git-core`
4. Clone the git repository `git clone 'git://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite.git'`
5. Install the dependencies `cd etherpad-lite && npm install`
6. Start it with `bin/run.sh`
7. Open your web browser and visit <http://localhost:9001>

# Next Steps
You can modify the settings in the file settings.json

You can update to the latest version with `git pull origin && npm install`

You can debug with `bin/runDebug.sh`
