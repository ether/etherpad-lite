# Making collaborative editing the standard on the web

# About
Etherpad lite is a really-real time collaborative editor spawned from the Hell fire of Etherpad. 
We're reusing the well tested Etherpad easysync library to make it really realtime. Etherpad Lite 
is based on node.js ergo is much lighter and more stable than the original Etherpad. Our hope 
is that this will encourage more users to use and install a realtime collaborative editor. A smaller, manageable and well 
documented codebase makes it easier for developers to improve the code and contribute towards the project.

Etherpad Lite is designed to be easily embeddable and provides a [HTTP API](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/HTTP-API) 
that allows your web application to manage pads, users and groups. It is recommended to use the [available client implementations]((https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/HTTP-API-client-libraries) in order to interact with this API. There is also a [jQuery plugin](https://github.com/johnyma22/etherpad-lite-jquery-plugin) that helps you to embed Pads into your website.
There's also a full-featured plugin framework, allowing you to easily add your own features.
Finally, Etherpad Lite comes with translations into tons of different languages!

# Installation

## Windows

### Prebuilt windows package
This package works out of the box on any windows machine, but it's not very useful for developing purposes...

1. Download the windows package <https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/downloads>
2. Extract the folder

Now, run `start.bat` and open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser. You like it? [Next steps](#next-steps).

### Fancy install
You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and (optionally, though recommended) git.

1. Grab the source, either
  - download <https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/zipball/master>
  - or `git clone https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git` (for this you need git, obviously)
2. start `bin\installOnWindows.bat`

Now, run `start.bat` and open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser.

Update to the latest version with `git pull origin`, then run `bin\installOnWindows.bat`, again.

[Next steps](#next-steps).

## Linux
You'll need gzip, git, curl, libssl develop libraries, python and gcc.  
*For Debian/Ubuntu*: `apt-get install gzip git-core curl python libssl-dev pkg-config build-essential`  
*For Fedora/CentOS*: `yum install gzip git-core curl python openssl-devel && yum groupinstall "Development Tools"`

Additionally, you'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed, Ideally the latest stable version, be careful of installing nodejs from apt.

**As any user (we recommend creating a separate user called etherpad-lite):**

1. Move to a folder where you want to install Etherpad Lite. Clone the git repository `git clone git://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git`
2. Change into the new directory containing the cloned source code `cd etherpad-lite`

Now, run `bin/run.sh` and open <http://127.0.0.1:9001> in your browser. 

Update to the latest version with `git pull origin`. The next start with bin/run.sh will update the dependencies.

# Next Steps

## Tweak the settings
You can modify the settings in `settings.json`. (If you need to handle multiple settings files, you can pass the path to a settings file to `bin/run.sh` using the `-s|--settings` option. This allows you to run multiple Etherpad Lite instances from the same installation.)

You should use a dedicated database such as "mysql", if you are planning on using etherpad-lite in a production environment, since the "dirtyDB" database driver is only for testing and/or development purposes.

## Helpful resources
The [wiki](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki) is your one-stop resource for Tutorials and How-to's, really check it out! Also, feel free to improve these wiki pages.

# Development

## Things you should know
Read this [git guide](http://learn.github.com/p/intro.html) and watch this [video on getting started with Etherpad Lite Development](http://youtu.be/67-Q26YH97E).

If you're new to node.js, start with Ryan Dahl's [Introduction to Node.js](http://youtu.be/jo_B4LTHi3I).

You can debug Etherpad lite using `bin/debugRun.sh`.

If you want to find out how Etherpad's `Easysync` works (the library that makes it really realtime), start with this [PDF](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/raw/master/doc/easysync/easysync-full-description.pdf) (complex, but worth reading).

## Getting started
You know all this and just want to know how you can help?

Look at the [TODO list](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/TODO) and our [Issue tracker](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues). (Please consider using [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/about/), if you plan to contribute code.)

Also, and most importantly, read our [**Developer Guidelines**](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/Developer-Guidelines), really!
