 *
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION
 * =================================
 *
 * All the configuration values can be read from environment variables using the
 * syntax "${ENV_VAR}" or "${ENV_VAR:default_value}".
 *
 * This is useful, for example, when running in a Docker container.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *    "port":     "${PORT:9001}"
 *    "minify":   "${MINIFY}"
 *    "skinName": "${SKIN_NAME:colibris}"
 *
 * Would read the configuration values for those items from the environment
 * variables PORT, MINIFY and SKIN_NAME.
 *
 * If PORT and SKIN_NAME variables were not defined, the default values 9001 and
 * "colibris" would be used.
 * The configuration value "minify", on the other hand, does not have a
 * designated default value. Thus, if the environment variable MINIFY were
 * undefined, "minify" would be null.
 *
 * REMARKS:
 * 1) please note that variable substitution always needs to be quoted.
 *
 *    "port":     9001,            <-- Literal values. When not using
 *    "minify":   false                substitution, only strings must be
 *    "skinName": "colibris"           quoted. Booleans and numbers must not.
 *
 *    "port":     "${PORT:9001}"   <-- CORRECT: if you want to use a variable
 *    "minify":   "${MINIFY:true}"     substitution, put quotes around its name,
 *    "skinName": "${SKIN_NAME}"       even if the required value is a number or
 *                                     a boolean.
 *                                     Etherpad will take care of rewriting it
 *                                     to the proper type if necessary.
 *
 *    "port":     ${PORT:9001}     <-- ERROR: this is not valid json. Quotes
 *    "minify":   ${MINIFY}            around variable names are missing.
 *    "skinName": ${SKIN_NAME}
 *
 * 2) Beware of undefined variables and default values: nulls and empty strings
 *    are different!
 *
 *    This is particularly important for user's passwords (see the relevant
 *    section):
 *
 *    "password": "${PASSW}"  // if PASSW is not defined would result in password === null
 *    "password": "${PASSW:}" // if PASSW is not defined would result in password === ''
