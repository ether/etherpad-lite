# Statistics
Etherpad keeps track of the goings-on inside the edit machinery. If you'd like to have a look at this, just point your browser to `/stats`.

We currently measure:

 - totalUsers (counter)
 - connects (meter)
 - disconnects (meter)
 - pendingEdits (counter)
 - edits (timer)
 - failedChangesets (meter)
 - httpRequests (timer)
 - http500 (meter)
 - memoryUsage (gauge)

Under the hood, we are happy to rely on [measured](https://github.com/felixge/node-measured) for all our metrics needs.

To modify or simply access our stats in your plugin, simply `require('ep_etherpad-lite/stats')` which is a [`measured.Collection`](https://yaorg.github.io/node-measured/packages/measured-core/Collection.html).
