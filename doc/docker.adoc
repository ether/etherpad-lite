== Docker

The official Docker image is available on https://hub.docker.com/r/etherpad/etherpad.

=== Downloading from Docker Hub
If you are ok downloading a https://hub.docker.com/r/etherpad/etherpad[prebuilt image from Docker Hub], these are the commands:

[source, bash]
----
# gets the latest published version
docker pull etherpad/etherpad

# gets a specific version
docker pull etherpad/etherpad:1.8.0
----

=== Build a personalized container

If you want to use a personalized settings file, **you will have to rebuild your image**.
All of the following instructions are as a member of the `docker` group.
By default, the Etherpad Docker image is built and run in `production` mode: no development dependencies are installed, and asset bundling speeds up page load time.

=== Building and running with docker compose
A docker compose file is provided in the project. Please first copy `.env.default` to `.env` and adjust the variables to your preference.

```
docker compose up -d # will build and start the docker container on port 9001 with development settings.
```

Starting dev server:

```
docker compose exec app bash -c "./bin/run.sh"
```

For production, please create your own docker compose file and change the `target` property in the build section to `production`. In addition, change the NODE_ENV in environment to production. For instance:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up -d
```

For plugins, please add them in the build section under ETHERPAD_PLUGINS, for instance:

```
     args:
        ETHERPAD_PLUGINS: >-
          ep_image_upload
          ep_embedded_hyperlinks2
          ep_headings2
          ep_align
					...
```

==== Rebuilding with custom settings
Edit `<BASEDIR>/settings.json.docker` at your will. When rebuilding the image, this file will be copied inside your image and renamed to `settings.json`.

**Each configuration parameter can also be set via an environment variable**, using the syntax `"${ENV_VAR}"` or `"${ENV_VAR:default_value}"`. For details, refer to `settings.json.template`.

==== Rebuilding including some plugins
If you want to install some plugins in your container, it is sufficient to list them in the ETHERPAD_PLUGINS build variable.
The variable value has to be a space separated, double quoted list of plugin names (see examples).

Some plugins will need personalized settings. Just refer to the previous section, and include them in your custom `settings.json.docker`.

==== Rebuilding including export functionality for DOC/PDF/ODT

If you want to be able to export your pads to DOC/PDF/ODT files, you can install
either Abiword or Libreoffice via setting a build variable.

===== Via Abiword

For installing Abiword, set the `INSTALL_ABIWORD` build variable to any value.

Also, you will need to configure the path to the abiword executable
via setting the `abiword` property in `<BASEDIR>/settings.json.docker` to
`/usr/bin/abiword` or via setting the environment variable  `ABIWORD` to
`/usr/bin/abiword`.

===== Via Libreoffice

For installing Libreoffice instead, set the `INSTALL_SOFFICE` build variable
to any value.

Also, you will need to configure the path to the libreoffice executable
via setting the `soffice` property in `<BASEDIR>/settings.json.docker` to
`/usr/bin/soffice` or via setting the environment variable  `SOFFICE` to
`/usr/bin/soffice`.

==== Examples

Build a Docker image from the currently checked-out code:

[source,bash]
----
docker build --tag <YOUR_USERNAME>/etherpad .
----

Include two plugins in the container:

[source,bash]
----
docker build --build-arg ETHERPAD_PLUGINS="ep_comments_page ep_author_neat" --tag <YOUR_USERNAME>/etherpad .
----

=== Running your instance:

To run your instance:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --detach --publish <DESIRED_PORT>:9001 <YOUR_USERNAME>/etherpad
----

And point your browser to `http://<YOUR_IP>:<DESIRED_PORT>`

=== Options available by default

The `settings.json.docker` available by default allows to control almost every setting via environment variables.
