# About this Documentation

<!-- type=misc -->

The goal of this documentation is to comprehensively explain Etherpad,
both from a reference as well as a conceptual point of view.

Where appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments
provided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic
heading.

Every `.html` file is generated based on the corresponding
`.md` file in the `doc/api/` folder in the source tree. The
documentation is generated using the `src/bin/doc/generate.js` program.
The HTML template is located at `doc/template.html`.
