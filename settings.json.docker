 *
 * ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION
 * =================================
 *
 * All the configuration values can be read from environment variables using the
 * syntax "${ENV_VAR}" or "${ENV_VAR:default_value}".
 *
 * This is useful, for example, when running in a Docker container.
 *
 * DETAILED RULES:
 *   - If the environment variable is set to the string "true" or "false", the
 *     value becomes Boolean true or false.
 *   - If the environment variable is set to the string "null", the value
 *     becomes null.
 *   - If the environment variable is set to the string "undefined", the setting
 *     is removed entirely, except when used as the member of an array in which
 *     case it becomes null.
 *   - If the environment variable is set to a string representation of a finite
 *     number, the string is converted to that number.
 *   - If the environment variable is set to any other string, including the
 *     empty string, the value is that string.
 *   - If the environment variable is unset and a default value is provided, the
 *     value is as if the environment variable was set to the provided default:
 *       - "${UNSET_VAR:}" becomes the empty string.
 *       - "${UNSET_VAR:foo}" becomes the string "foo".
 *       - "${UNSET_VAR:true}" and "${UNSET_VAR:false}" become true and false.
 *       - "${UNSET_VAR:null}" becomes null.
 *       - "${UNSET_VAR:undefined}" causes the setting to be removed (or be set
 *         to null, if used as a member of an array).
 *   - If the environment variable is unset and no default value is provided,
 *     the value becomes null. THIS BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE IN A FUTURE VERSION OF
 *     ETHERPAD; if you want the default value to be null, you should explicitly
 *     specify "null" as the default value.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *    "port":     "${PORT:9001}"
 *    "minify":   "${MINIFY}"
 *    "skinName": "${SKIN_NAME:colibris}"
 *
 * Would read the configuration values for those items from the environment
 * variables PORT, MINIFY and SKIN_NAME.
 *
 * If PORT and SKIN_NAME variables were not defined, the default values 9001 and
 * "colibris" would be used.
 * The configuration value "minify", on the other hand, does not have a
 * designated default value. Thus, if the environment variable MINIFY were
 * undefined, "minify" would be null.
 *
 * REMARKS:
 * 1) please note that variable substitution always needs to be quoted.
 *
 *    "port":     9001,            <-- Literal values. When not using
 *    "minify":   false                substitution, only strings must be
 *    "skinName": "colibris"           quoted. Booleans and numbers must not.
 *
 *    "port":     "${PORT:9001}"   <-- CORRECT: if you want to use a variable
 *    "minify":   "${MINIFY:true}"     substitution, put quotes around its name,
 *    "skinName": "${SKIN_NAME}"       even if the required value is a number or
 *                                     a boolean.
 *                                     Etherpad will take care of rewriting it
 *                                     to the proper type if necessary.
 *
 *    "port":     ${PORT:9001}     <-- ERROR: this is not valid json. Quotes
 *    "minify":   ${MINIFY}            around variable names are missing.
 *    "skinName": ${SKIN_NAME}
 *
 * 2) Beware of undefined variables and default values: nulls and empty strings
 *    are different!
 *
 *    This is particularly important for user's passwords (see the relevant
 *    section):
 *
 *    "password": "${PASSW}"  // if PASSW is not defined would result in password === null
 *    "password": "${PASSW:}" // if PASSW is not defined would result in password === ''
 *
 *    If you want to use an empty value (null) as default value for a variable,
 *    simply do not set it, without putting any colons: "${ABIWORD}".
 *
 * 3) if you want to use newlines in the default value of a string parameter,
 *    use "\n" as usual.
